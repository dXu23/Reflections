1. **How did viewing a diff between two files help you spot the bug?**
Seeing the diff between the two files helped me see what changed between a previous working version and the newer version.

2. **How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long run?**
If I make a change to the program that completely messes it up, I can just revert back to a previous version.

3. **What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?**
**Pros**
- More control
- Commits make more logical sense

**Cons**
- Not useful for people that are forgetful

4. **Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, treat each file separately?**
For programmers, files are often interrelated, so a change in one file might affect another. This is not the case in Google Docs, where
most of the time, a change in one files does not have an effect on any of the others.

5. **How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?**
git log lists the previous commits, while git diff identifies differences between different commits. 

6. **How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?**
Now, I know that even if something breaks, I can just go back to a previous version.

7. **Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?**
I want to use Git for my school projects.
